# Pomodoro App Development Plan

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Environment Configuration

1. **Create a new Flutter project**

   - Run `flutter create pomodoro`
   - Set up project structure with appropriate folders (lib/screens, lib/widgets, lib/services, etc.)

2. **Configure app theme for dark mode**

   - Create a theme configuration file with dark mode color scheme
   - Implement global dark theme in main.dart

3. **Add required dependencies**
   - Add wakelock package for keeping screen awake
   - Add audio player package for sound alerts
   - Add state management solution (Provider)
   - Add animation libraries if needed
   - Update pubspec.yaml and run `flutter pub get`

## Phase 2: Core Components Development

1. **Create models and state management**

   - Create Timer model class for handling timer logic
   - Set up Provider state management for app-wide state
   - Implement timer service with countdown logic
   - Create timer state classes (Focus, ShortBreak, LongBreak)

2. **Build UI components**
   - Create custom dial timer widget
   - Develop dropdown and selection components for timer settings
   - Design buttons and interactive elements
   - Implement responsive layouts

## Phase 3: Screen Implementation

1. **Splash Screen**

   - Create splash screen layout with app logo/name
   - Implement fade/scale animations
   - Add navigation logic to automatically proceed to Time Selection screen after delay

2. **Time Selection Screen**

   - Implement UI with dropdowns for duration selection:
     - Focus session duration selector
     - Short break duration selector
     - Long break duration selector
     - Number of sessions selector
   - Add Start button at bottom of screen
   - Add Tutorial button
   - Connect UI to state management

3. **Tutorial Screen**

   - Create tutorial screen with step-by-step instructions
   - Add explanatory text and possibly illustrations
   - Implement navigation back to Time Selection screen

4. **Timer Screen**
   - Develop the dial timer UI with animations
   - Add current mode indicator (Focus/Short Break/Long Break)
   - Implement tap gesture detection:
     - Single tap for pause/resume
     - Double tap for exit confirmation
   - Add session progress indicator

## Phase 4: Core Functionality Implementation

1. **Timer Logic**

   - Implement countdown mechanism
   - Add mode transition logic (Focus → Short Break → Focus → ... → Long Break)
   - Develop session tracking and cycle management
   - Connect timer to UI updates

2. **Wakelock Integration**

   - Implement screen wakelock during active timer sessions
   - Ensure wakelock is disabled when timer ends or app exits

3. **Sound Alerts**

   - Add sound files to project assets
   - Implement audio player service
   - Trigger sounds on mode transitions

4. **Navigation and User Interaction**
   - Set up navigation routes between screens
   - Implement exit confirmation dialog
   - Connect user actions to state changes

## Phase 5: Testing and Refinement

1. **Unit and Widget Testing**

   - Write tests for timer logic
   - Test state management
   - Verify proper screen transitions

2. **Integration Testing**

   - Test full app flow from splash to completion of a full cycle
   - Verify proper handling of user interactions
   - Test edge cases (rapid taps, background/foreground transitions)

3. **UI Polish and Animation Refinement**

   - Improve animations and transitions
   - Ensure consistent styling throughout the app
   - Optimize performance

4. **User Experience Testing**
   - Conduct user testing sessions
   - Gather feedback on timer functionality and ease of use
   - Make UX improvements based on feedback

## Phase 6: Final Touches

1. **Error Handling**

   - Implement robust error handling
   - Add graceful fallbacks for edge cases
   - Add logging for debugging

2. **Documentation**

   - Document code and implementation details
   - Create user guide/help documentation within the app

3. **Pre-release Optimization**

   - Perform code cleanup and refactoring
   - Optimize performance and resource usage
   - Reduce package size if needed

4. **App Launch Preparation**
   - Prepare app store assets (screenshots, descriptions)
   - Configure build settings for release
   - Perform final testing on release build
